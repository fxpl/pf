%% TODOs
%
% - Should be able to place labels in the top-most scope of the
% current proof so that you can cross-reference cases. This also
% means that \pfref needs to be able to pick the scope (local or
% proof-global).
%
% - Could try to allow placing labels (and \pfref:ing labels) in
% the surrounding scope, moving outwards in the hierarchy. My
% guess is that this is more general than is needed!
%
% - The pftheorem environment should give a name to the theorem
% being proved and initialize counters. There should probably be a
% general environment that can be reused for pftheorem, pflemma,
% pfproposition...
%
% - The pfstatement and pfsketch environments should allow stating
% and providing a proof sketch.
%
% - It would be nice to have a standardized way of providing
% assumptions (e.g., a pfassumptions environment)
%
% - It might be a good idea to have a simple pfsteps environment
% for the steps in a case, mostly to be able to standardize that.
